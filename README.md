This is the front-end repository for DeepClock. Authored by Advait Kalakkad

# About:
DeepClock is an experiment in evaluating a deep learning model's ability to tell time. The application consists of a Twitter bot that retrieves images posted with the hashtag #deepclock. The app retweets the image with the time it predicts it to be. The website we've built serves as a data visualization of DeepClock's predictions, in order to give visitors insight into what patterns DeepClock unearths in the process of learning to tell time.

# Current Build
DeepClock's front end is built using a node.js application and the twit package. Currently I am working on building visualization tools to display the full archive of images DeepClock receives. The data visualizations will be powered by mySQL via node.js.
