# About:
DeepClock is an experiment in evaluating a deep learning model's ability to tell time. The application consists of a Twitter bot that retrieves images posted with the hashtag #deepclock. The app retweets the image with the time it predicts it to be. The website we've built serves as a data visualization of DeepClock's predictions, in order to give visitors insight into what patterns DeepClock unearths in the process of learning to tell time.
